***In this direcotry I will be performing my analysis on my data set on credit card default rates***
# I hope to answer my research question regarding whether there are correlations between credit card default and people 
*Milestone 1 Analysis*
# I imported my data into my analysis file, and got a first look at all the variables and rows
*Milestone 2 Analysis*
# I started to explore my data and mess around with: 
`.info()`

`.describe()`

`.mean()`
## I also started wrangling my data by renaming columns that did not makesense to me, such as PAY_0 to PAY_1, and shortened some of the column names as they long and cumbersome when coding

### I then created my first method chain, it was fairly simple once I got the hang of it and then converted it into a function so it is more versatile and then created my first python module!
