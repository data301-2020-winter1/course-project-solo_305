## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

  My topic is on the rate of credit card default. I've chosen this data set as I am currently studying accounting, and finances as my specialty for my undergraduate degree. I am interested in discovering if age, education, and marital status effects the amounts put on credit cards and whether there are any conclusions that can be drawn about different types of people defaulting on their credit cards. I am interested in the risk management perspective of this data set and its implications in helping define who is or isn't a credible person to expend a line of credit or if any set of data can accurately allow conclusions or assumptions to be drawn. I'm hoping to answer the question, can certain types of peoples be classified as a credible lender by their age, marital status or education level? I would also like to look at the general rate of default among these credit card users, as from my current studies I've seen how quickly credit card debt can increase and become too much to pay back. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

My data set contains research from Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of the rate of default on credit cards using six data mining methods. It was formulated at Tamkang University in the department of Management in 2016. It was created for a predictive purpose of seeing if generalizations between good or bad credit card users exist and if this data could be used to classify people applying for a credit card. 

My data set contains demographics,(age, marital status, and education level), credit card limit, balance and payment amounts. It is from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It contains integers, multivariate characteristics and has 24 attributes. It employs a binary variable (default payment), as the response variable and used 23 explanatory variables. It used the sorting smoothing method to estimate the real rate of default.
